# Bike Rental Prediction MLOps Pipeline 🚲

## Overview
This project implements a full Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) pipeline for predicting bike rentals using AWS Cloud and a local setup. It includes:
- Data Preprocessing
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Training
- Model Inference
- Saving Models and Predictions

Designed to be cloud-friendly, simple, modular, and production-ready!

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔥 How to Run

### Step 1: Preprocess Data

```bash
python scripts/preprocessing.py
```

- Reads `bike_rental.csv`
- Cleans, scales, splits into train/test
- Saves processed files into `processed/`

### Step 2: Train and Tune Model

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

- Loads train/test splits
- Runs RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- Saves the best model to `models/`

### Step 3: Model Inference

```bash
python scripts/model_inference.py
```

- Loads the trained model and test set
- Generates predictions
- Saves results to `predictions/`

## 📚 Key Features

- Clean train-test split
- Feature scaling (without scaling the target)
- Randomized Search for hyperparameter tuning
- Joblib-based model persistence
- Modular and extensible structure

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Add FastAPI server for real-time inference
- Integrate MLflow for tracking experiments
- Setup Airflow for end-to-end automation
- Expand to multiple models (XGBoost, LightGBM)
